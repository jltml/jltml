Hello! Per the header, I'm Jack MapelLentz, or jltml pretty much everywhere where five-character usernames are allowed/available. I'm currently a senior (fourth-year undergrad) majoring in [Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://cbe.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). Most of my repositories are just small projects I've worked on. I've pinned some of the more useful ones below, though; maybe something there will end up being helpful for someone. Enjoy!

Oh, also — the photo above is from Zion National Park's Kolob Canyons viewpoint. I thought this would be nicer with a photo, so voilà.
