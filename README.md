Hi! So per the header, I'm Jack MapelLentz, or jltml pretty much everywhere where five-character usernames are allowed &/or where available. The main thing here (at the moment) is my website, which I started in 2018. If you're exceedingly bored, you can read a bit about it [here](https://jltml.me/misc/#about-this-website). I still have a long way to go. On a much smaller note, I also wrote some CSS that gives Wikipedia a dark mode, which is [here](https://github.com/jltml/wikipedia-darkmode). It's far from perfect, but it's nonetheless *much* better than being blinded at midnight. Beyond that, there's not a ton here yet — but I have quite a few ideas of things I'd like to do soon, so stay tuned!

Oh, also — the photo above is from Zion National Park's Kolbob Canyons viewpoint. I thought this would be nicer with a photo, so I just picked one.
