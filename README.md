Hello! Per the header, I'm Jack MapelLentz, or jltml pretty much everywhere where five-character usernames are allowed/available. I'm currently a junior (third-year undergrad) majoring in [Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://cbe.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). There's not a ton here, really; it's mostly just random projects I've made. I've pinned some of the more useful ones below, though… maybe something there will end up being helpful to someone. Enjoy!

Oh, also — the photo above is from Zion National Park's Kolob Canyons viewpoint. I thought this would be nicer with a photo, so voilà.
